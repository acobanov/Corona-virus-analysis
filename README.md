# Corona-virus-analysis
Analysing Corona virus data

-importing data from json file
-creating list of data frames for EU countries and Croatia's neighbours
-creating 'long' data frame containing all data
-creating 'wide' data frames for confirmed cases, deaths, recoverd and new cases

Program code is very good example how to use my favourite function from 'purrr' package (map).
With 'named lists' and 'map' function, program code can be easily generalized.
In this example, two different analysis: 'eu' and 'cro' are wrapped up together.
